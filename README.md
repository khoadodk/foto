<p align="center">A photo sharing react app with Sanity CMS</p>

## Challenges

- State management: Redux/Context API needed as the project getting bigger and the state is getting messier.
- Google OAuth API is migrating to v2 causing bugs.

## Todo List

- Add state management.
- Add email/password OAuth system using firebase authentication.

## Tech choice

- TailwindCSS: similar to bootstrap but give you more freedom in term of styling customization.
- Sanity CMS: the most powerful headless CMS with a good documation. They have uncached and cached APIs, GraphQL suported and React friendly.
